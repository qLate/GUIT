CMake Warning (dev) at /snap/clion/250/bin/cmake/linux/x64/share/cmake-3.26/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args`
  (WAYLAND_CLIENT) does not match the name of the calling package (Wayland).
  This can lead to problems in calling code that expects `find_package`
  result variables (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  FindWayland.cmake:70 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
